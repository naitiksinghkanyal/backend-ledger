📌 Project Overview : Secure Banking System Backend

The Banking Ledger App is a backend-focused application designed to simulate a secure and efficient banking system. It allows users to manage accounts, record transactions, and track balances in a ledger format. This project demonstrates strong backend skills, database design, and API development.

🔐 Key Features Implemented:
•) Secure authentication using JWT.
•) Password hashing with bcrypt.
•)Token blacklisting for logout security.
•) Middleware-based route protection.
•) Email validation & automated notifications.
•) Environment variable configuration for secure deployments.

💳 Banking & System Design Concepts:
•) Account, Transaction, and Ledger models.
•) Ledger-based balance derivation (instead of storing balance directly).
•) Idempotency validation to prevent duplicate transactions.
•) Pending transaction state handling.
•) Aggregation pipelines to compute accurate balances.
•) Account status validation before transfers.

🛠 Tech Stack:

Node.js | Express.js | MongoDB (Atlas) | JWT | Bcrypt | Nodemailer | Postman

📌 What This Project Strengthened:
•) Designing fault-tolerant transaction flows.
•) Writing structured, scalable backend architecture.
•) Implementing security best practices in authentication.
•) Thinking in terms of system reliability, not just features.

This project gave me a much deeper appreciation for how financial systems ensure data integrity and consistency under real-world conditions.
